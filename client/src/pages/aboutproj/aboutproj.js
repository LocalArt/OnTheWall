    <p>
      We are FlipArtWall, creators of Flippity Flop, Flipper's favorite Flash
      Card App. Now we have built OnTheWall, a React App for Artists and Venue
      Owners to connect. Artists want to display their art to potential
      customers. Venue Owners want decorative and interesting art on the walls
      and in their place of business. We help both of them by facilitating
      introductions to each other.

      At the home page users are welcomed into a world of beautiful possibility
      - "What wonderful and unique items can I display at low or no cost?" or
      "Where will my life's work go to be appreciated and eventually purchased?"
